Developed for drivers who care about how tire technology enhances their vehicle's performance and safety, Pilot Super Sport tires expand the Max Performance Summer tire performance envelope by delivering durability, handling and traction while increasing tread life.\nThe Pilot Super Sport features an asymmetric design molded of Michelin's Bi-Compound tread rubber featuring a Le Mans-inspired dry compound outboard side-by-side with their latest generation of wet compound inboard. The low-void outboard shoulder features a track-type compound to withstand the stresses of high performance cornering while the notched center ribs and inboard shoulder feature a compound designed for superior performance at very high speeds and in wet conditions.\n\nThe tire's internal structure features twin steel belts reinforced by spirally wound Twaron cord. Twaron is a polyamide cord that offers a lightweight, high-strength reinforcement above the steel belts to enhance high-speed handling, wear and durability. Michelin FAZ Technology (Filament At Zero degrees) winds the Twaron cord around the tire circumference much the same way fishing line is wound onto fishing reels to allow Michelin engineers to tune tension and strength. The Pilot Super Sport features a polyester casing to promote a comfortable ride and responsive handling.\n\nPilot Super Sport tires are comparatively light, with weight savings of up to 10% compared to other tires of similar dimensions. This reduces unsprung weight to improve handling.\n\nVIEW PHOTOS FOR DETAILS\n\nTires are sold AS IS and NO RETURNS\n", price: 250.0, address: "412 Tully Road", latitude: 37.3374337278474, longitude: -121.888225078583, archived: "f", user_id: 103, city_id: 5, category_id: 2},

She played it throughout her long life, once confiding in me that \" I like (my) violin. . .but I love my bow.\" Its octagonal shaft is stiff and features a light brown color. At 60g, the bow is pretty light and almost without any sensible balance-point. Its head is shaped precisely and demonstrates Prager´s experience and skills. The ebony frog is distinctively designed, the slide and the Parisian eyes are made of white mother of pearl. The total length of the bow is 74.0 cm, its measured balance-point is at 26.10 cm from the frog end. Violin bows by AE Prager are internationally sought after, and his excellent reputation is proven in this example. This fine bow has been worked over by master bow maker John Greenwood, and is offered ready to produce a bright, brilliant, shining and open sound. Asking $3600.\n\nPlease contact me with questions.
