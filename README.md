## Minimum Viable Product (MVC)

MacksList is inspired by CraigsList, a community driven website where users are able to list local advertisements for free. MacksList is built using Ruby on Rails and React.js. With MacksList, users can enjoy the features of CraigsList with an updated UI that utilizes the benefits of React.js.

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Create an account
- [ ] Log in / Log out
- [ ] Create, view, edit, and delete personal ads
- [ ] Search through listings
- [ ] Filter listings based off desired results
- [ ] "Star" listings to keep track of ads
- [ ] Use Google Maps to view ad locations
