## Minimum Viable Product (MVC)

MacksList is inspired by CraigsList, a community driven website where users are able to list local advertisements for free. MacksList is built using Ruby on Rails and React.js. With MacksList, users can enjoy the features of CraigsList with an updated UI that utilizes the benefits of React.js.

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Create an account
- [ ] Log in / Log out
- [ ] Create, view, edit, and delete personal ads
- [ ] Search through listings
- [ ] Filter listings based off desired results
- [ ] "Star" listings to keep track of ads
- [ ] Use Google Maps to view ad locations

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Ad Model and JSON API [1.5 day(s)]

In Phase 1, I will implement the entire auth portion. You will be able to login/sign up. Upon login, you will be redirected to a user show page, which will contain will just contain empty templates for future features.
I will also set up the model for the ads as well as implementing an api interface to interact with ad data.

### Phase 2: Setup Flux [(1) day(s)]


## Phase 3: Setup Ad CRUD
Phase 2 will focus on implementing Ad CRUD which is the main data type for my project.

## Phase 4: Setup Ad CRUD

## Database Seeding and UI testing [1 day(s)]
One day will be dedicated entirely to setting up the seed database with presentable data. The database will need to include a variety of ads from different cities and categories.

The latter part of the day will also be spent checking overall UI compatibility. I will use the following checklist, which is ordered by priority.

UI Compatibility Checklist:
- [ ] Smoke test of all UI components
- [ ] Reasonable compatibility across browsers
- [ ] Resolve all UI issues
- [ ] Note necessary styling changes for next day

## Phase 5: Styling and cleanup [1 day(s)]
I will spend the last day of my project making any additional styling changes that are necessary. I will also do minor refactoring of code, being sure to make use of git branching (as to not permanently break anything), and clean up my code to be more presentable. The primary goal is to clean up my code and this serves as more of a final check.

### Bonus Features [ ? day(s)]
